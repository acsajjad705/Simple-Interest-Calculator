# Simple Interest Calculator

## Overview
This repository documents a Simple Interest Calculator. It explains the formula, usage examples, and where to find the implementation files.

## Formula
Simple Interest (SI) is calculated as:



\[
\text{SI} = \frac{P \cdot R \cdot T}{100}
\]



where **P** = principal amount, **R** = annual interest rate (percent), **T** = time in years.

## Features
- Calculates simple interest.
- Shows total amount (principal + interest).
- Example inputs and expected outputs included.

## Example
**Input**  
P = 1000, R = 5, T = 2

**Output**  
Simple Interest = 100  
Total Amount = 1100

## Files
- `README.md` — this file.
- `calculator.py` — example Python implementation (optional).
- `index.html` / `script.js` — example web implementation (optional).

## How to run (Python example)
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run:
```bash
python3 calculator.py
